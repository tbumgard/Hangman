This is my first personal project for boot.dev.  It shows off my abilities to code in python.

The program is hangman with multiple players supported.

To clone the project you can pull it with git from the public URL https://github.com/tbumgard/Hangman/
The main program to run is hangman.py and should be able to run from the command line in the Hangman directory
by running ./Hangman: python hangman.py

The other files/folders in the directory/repository are not very relevant to the program.

/hangman/ - 
/tests/ - 
hangman.py - Main project source code (relevant)
Makefile - A makefile that has poetry as a dependency and contains 3 commands to select from:
    run - Runs the program 
    test - Tests the program using pytest
    fmt - Formats the .py files to a standard using black
pyproject.toml - A file used by poetry
README.md - This file that explains the project and how to obtain it, run it and its contents
